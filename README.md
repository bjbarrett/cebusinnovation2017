# cebusinnovation2017
This is a repository for data, model code, and plotting code for Perry, Barrett &amp; Godoy's 2017 paper: Older, sociable white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) invent more social behaviors; younger monkeys innovate more in other contexts. 

To rerun the analyses you will require McElreath's rethinking package and have r-STAN installed: https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking

1.Main Paper Results for Innovation Across Domains

The main datafile of innovations of individuals is called "PNASfinaldomainindividual_git.csv". 

2.Group Level Annual Innovation Rates

To reproduce analyses and graphs used in Figure 1, code can be found in the "group_preds_git.R" file. Data is loaded from the file "PNASinnovationlistused_git.csv" and then manipulated using supllied code to be ready for analyses.

3.Supplemental Analyses on Social Transmsision 
Code for models and analyses can be found in the file "inno_transmission_git.R"
"PNASinnovationlistused_git.csv" is necessary for constructing the dataset.
